When it detects danger, it sounds alarms, like loud sensors and flashing lights, to warn people. It can also send messages to phones and computers to let everyone know there's a problem. This system can even take action to stop the fire, like turning on sprinklers or closing doors. It's like having a helpful guardian that keeps everyone safe from fires. ",
